# Graph Cycle Detection using Depth-First Search (DFS)

This project was developed as part of the **Algorithms: Theory, Design and Implementation (5SENG003C.2 / 5SENG003W)** coursework at the **University of Westminster / Informatics Institute of Technology**.  

The aim of this coursework is to implement an algorithm to check whether a given directed graph is **acyclic**. If the graph contains a cycle, the program detects and outputs the cycle. The implementation is done in **Java**, using the **Depth-First Search (DFS)** algorithm.

## 📌 Features
- Representation of directed graphs using efficient Java data structures (`HashMap`, `HashSet`, `ArrayList`).
- Input parser to read graph edges from a file.
- Cycle detection using **DFS with recursion** and backtracking.
- Produces detailed output, showing traversal and detected cycles.
- Benchmark tests on **acyclic** and **cyclic** examples.
- Includes **performance analysis** (time and space complexity).

## 📖 Coursework Context
This project addresses the following coursework tasks:

1. **Project Setup** – Java project setup and structure.  
2. **Data Structures** – Graph representation using adjacency lists.  
3. **Input Parser** – Reads graph data from text files containing pairs of numbers (edges).  
4. **Algorithm Implementation** – Determines if the graph is acyclic using DFS.  
5. **Cycle Detection** – Outputs a cycle if found in the graph.  
6. **Report** – Explains choice of algorithm and data structures, benchmarks, and complexity analysis.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Java (JDK 17)
- **Core Data Structures**:
  - `HashMap<Integer, ArrayList<Integer>>` → For adjacency list representation of graphs
  - `HashSet<Integer>` → For tracking visited vertices and current recursion stack
  - `ArrayList<Integer>` → For storing detected cycles and neighbor lists

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

Algorithm
- Depth-First Search (DFS): Chosen for its efficiency in cycle detection and memory optimization
- Time Complexity: O(|V| + |E|) where V is vertices and E is edges
- Space Complexity: O(|V|) in worst case due to recursion stack
